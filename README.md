# wp-redis-install
For quickly adding redis support to wp installs after redis-server is setup and running.


1. Clone this repo to your web root.  e.g.) /var/www/redis/
2. Navigate to an instance of WP. e.g.) /var/www/example.com/
3. `cp ../redis/install-redis.sh ./`
4. `sh ./istall-redis.sh`

That's it!
